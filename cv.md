### About Me:

Since childhood, I dreamed of becoming a doctor. Therefore, I graduated from the Smolensk State Medical University. But the reality of working as a doctor did not meet my expectations. It is important for me not to be tied to a place, so the profession of a front-end developer is very close to me, since you can work anywhere in the world. I think that this is a very creative profession, often requiring non-standard solutions. Therefore, now my goal is to gain knowledge in front-end development areas.
